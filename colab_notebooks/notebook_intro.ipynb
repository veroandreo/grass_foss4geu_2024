On the right, you can find the **data** browser which allows you to navigate through your projects and data, and the **layers** panel showing displayed layers. The panel in the middle is the **map display**. You can add additional ones if you need. Finally, on the right there are multiple tabs where you can find a searchable *tools' tree* similar to the Processing toolbox in QGIS, a *console* where you can type GRASS commands, the *history* of executed commands in case you want to re-run a task and a simple *Python console* where you can use the GRASS Python API.\n",
