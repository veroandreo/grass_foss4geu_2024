## {{< fa solid dna >}} About 
[**Verónica Andreo**](https://veroandreo.gitlab.io/) is a biologist. She holds 
a PhD in Biological Sciences and an MSc in Remote Sensing and GIS applications. 
She works as a researcher for [CONICET](https://www.conicet.gov.ar/) and 
lecturer at [Gulich Institute](http://ig.conae.unc.edu.ar/) - Argentinian Space
Agency [(CONAE)](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/ciencia/conae) in Córdoba, Argentina.
Her research is focused on uncovering **environmental drivers of vector-borne disease outbreaks**. She is mostly interested in those environmental features 
that can be derived **by means of satellite image analysis, remote sensing time series and GIS-based techniques**. 


Verónica is part of the [GRASS GIS](https://grass.osgeo.org/) Development team
and currently serves as the [PSC chair](https://grass.osgeo.org/news/2021_02_05_new_grass_psc/). 
She is a strong advocate for [OSGeo](https://www.osgeo.org/) and free and open 
source software for geo-spatial (FOSS4G). She was the Program Committee
chair for [**FOSS4G 2021**](2021.foss4g.org/). Among other things, she has 
volunteered as a mentor for GRASS GIS in the 
[Google Code-In contest](https://codein.withgoogle.com/) 
introducing high school students into the Open Source world.
