Traditionally, species distribution models (SDM) use climatic data as predictors of habitat suitability for the target species. In this studio, we will explore the use of satellite data to derive relevant predictors. The satellite data processing, from download to analysis, will be performed using GRASS GIS software functionality. Then, we'll read our predictors within R and perform SDM, visualize and analyze results there, to then exemplify how to write the output distribution maps back into GRASS.

# Run this session online

We'll run this session online within the [Whole Tale platform](https://wholetale.org/). 
Whole Tale is an NSF-funded Data Infrastructure Building Block (DIBBS) initiative
to build a scalable, open source, web-based, multi-user platform for reproducible
research. It enables the creation, publication, and execution of tales - executable
research objects that capture data, code, and the complete software environment 
used to produce research findings. It's also great for teaching, as participants
do not need to install all software packages required. They only need to register 
with institutional or personal email and they are ready to go!

**Run the session online:** [Let's combine GRASS, Python and R](https://dashboard.wholetale.org/run/6680363e7b5d52be57b740c5?tab=metadata)

If The Whole Tale does not work, we'll use Google Colab. In that case, we'll
need to open the notebooks stored [here]() within Colab as shown below:

Furthermore, we'll need to set up our environment within Google Drive. See @sec-data.

# Run this session locally

## Software 

If you still want to run the workshop locally, you'll find instructions and 
requirements below.

### GRASS GIS

We will use **GRASS GIS 8.3+**. It can be installed either 
through standalone installers/binaries or through
[OSGeo-Live](https://live.osgeo.org/en/index.html) 
(a linux based virtual machine which includes all OSGeo software and packages).

##### MS Windows

For Windows users, we **strongly recommend** installing GRASS GIS through the **[OSGeo4W](http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/v2/osgeo4w-setup.exe) package**, 
since it allows to install all OSGeo software and resolves dependencies. 

##### Ubuntu Linux

Install GRASS GIS 8.3+ from the "unstable" package repository:

```bash
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install grass grass-gui grass-dev
```

##### Fedora, openSuSe Linux

For other Linux distributions including **Fedora** and **openSuSe**, simply 
install GRASS GIS with the respective package manager. See also [here](https://grass.osgeo.org/download/linux/)

##### Mac OS

Find GRASS GIS binaries on <http://grassmac.wikidot.com/> or install the 
latest available version from [MacPorts](https://ports.macports.org/port/grass/).

#### GRASS GIS Add-ons 

* [r.bioclim](https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/addons/r.bioclim.html): Calculates bioclimatic indices as those in [WorldClim](https://www.worldclim.org/bioclim).

Install with `g.extension extension=name_of_addon`

### R packages

The following R packages should be installed beforehand:

```r
  install.packages(c("rgrass","terra","sf","mapview","biomod2","dismo","usdm","SDMtune","zeallot","rJava","ggpubr"))
```

### Python libraries

The following Python libraries should be installed beforehand:

```bash
  pip install folium 
```

## Other software

We will use the software **MaxEnt** to model habitat suitability. It can be 
downloaded from: <https://biodiversityinformatics.amnh.org/open_source/maxent/>

## Data {#sec-data}

<img src="assets/img/studio/aedes_albopictus.jpg" width="30%" align="right"/>

- Records of *Aedes albopictus* (Asian tiger mosquito) in Northern Italy
  downloaded from [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/)
- Average daily MODIS LST reconstructed by 
  [mundialis GmbH & Co. KG](https://www.mundialis.de/en/) based on @metz_new_2017:
    - 1 km spatial resolution
    - Converted to Celsius degrees

### Get the sample project

- Create a folder named `grass_foss4geu_2024`
- Within `grass_foss4geu_2024` create a folder named `grassdata`
- Download the [eu_laea project with LST mapset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z1b2NLC4Z6yzz_57RddTdRRK_gUkd7fU/view?usp=sharing)
and unzip it within your `grassdata` folder
- Download [mosquito data](https://github.com/veroandreo/grass_ncsu_2023/raw/main/data/aedes_albopictus.gpkg) and drop it within `grass_foss4geu_2024`

The `grass_foss4geu_2024` folder's tree should look like this:

```         
  grass_foss4geu_2024/
  ├── aedes_albopictus.gpkg
  └── grassdata
      └── eu_laea
          ├── italy_LST_daily
          └── PERMANENT

```

## Clone the repo and execute notebooks

Once you are set with software installation and data, you should
download or clone the following repo:
<https://github.com/veroandreo/grass_foss4geu_2024>
and execute notebooks in Jupyter and Rstudio, respectively.
